Neon Overlords is a passion project that I intend to solo develop over time. All art, programming and music will be done by me. 

I want this to be a Metroidvania experience that changes depending on which character you play as - mechanics and music wise mainly. 

So far I have three character concepts as of Oct 16th 2024:

- Irabel - Scourge of the Dancefloor - Irabel is a crazy death metal, hardbass loving queen. As leader of the Ballroom Crew,  Irabel inherited her love for music and sonic based weaponry from a record owner that raised her. Now fighting to keep Neon City free of The Mobs, she gives you her axe and her rage.  You can play as an early of iteration of Irabel in this prototype

- K0MR4d - The Red Nightmare - description incoming

- Baron Ricolino - Avatar of Hunger  - description incoming



During 2025 I want to:

- Build logic to allow character switches

- Code K0mR4d and Baron Ricolino

- Finish a level that contains a boss that spawns after certain criteria is met

- Prepare to distribute for other people to play and give me some feedback 



For a full release I would hope: 

- To have at least 4 characters

- A Boss Rush Mode

- A Time Attack Mode

-  A Music listening feature

- Art that unlocks with achievements
